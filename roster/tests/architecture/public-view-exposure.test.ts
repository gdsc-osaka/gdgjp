/**
 * The 10th architecture test (docs/roster/09-share-public-views.md "Design"
 * §4, docs/roster/adr.md ADR-005): the public view must never expose
 * experience levels, even indirectly through an import that never renders
 * visibly. ADR-005's own Context is explicit about why a UI-only guard isn't
 * enough — "it'll get re-added because it's convenient" is the exact failure
 * mode this pins down mechanically instead of aspirationally, the same
 * rationale ADR-003 gives for every other test in this directory.
 *
 * Scans `app/features/public-roster/` (non-test source) AND
 * `app/routes/r.$token.tsx` for the identifiers/literals that would carry
 * the experience-level concept in: the `Level` type, the `LEVELS` tuple
 * (plus its sibling constants — `LEVEL_LABELS`/`LEVEL_DESCRIPTIONS`/
 * `DEFAULT_LEVEL`, cheap to add once the mechanism exists), and the bare
 * string literals `"lead"`/`"exp"`. Deliberately does NOT ban the substring
 * "new" (also a `Level` value) — every file in this codebase writes
 * `new Map()`/`new Date()`, so that would be nothing but false positives;
 * docs/roster/09-share-public-views.md's own "Design" §4 omits it from the
 * list for the same reason.
 *
 * `r.$token.tsx` is scanned explicitly, not just the feature directory: it's
 * the actual rendered public route (not merely a consumer of
 * `public-roster/`'s exports) and it already imports from
 * `~/features/solver/types`, where `Level` is independently declared
 * (ADR-004 keeps the solver's own `Level` separate from `applications/
 * types.ts`'s) — a future "let's just show it in the role view too" edit
 * landing directly in the route file would be invisible to this test if it
 * only scanned the feature directory. This gap was caught in review; keep
 * both targets when either file moves or splits.
 *
 * NOTE: this is a raw-text scan, not comment-aware — a doc comment inside
 * either target that merely *mentions* "Level" or a quoted "lead"/"exp"
 * will also trip this test. That's an accepted false-positive risk (write
 * around it, e.g. "経験レベル" in Japanese, rather than loosening the regex)
 * given the alternative is a real detection gap.
 *
 * Uses the readFileSync + regex pattern already established by
 * `layering.test.ts`/`file-size.test.ts`/`test-colocation.test.ts` in this
 * same directory (ported from `wiki/tests/architecture/`, ADR-003) rather
 * than a real import-graph analyzer — the stage doc explicitly allows this
 * ("1 は import 解析...難しいので...でも良い").
 *
 * The loader's actual RETURNED DATA (email/contact/note/skills/availability/
 * locked, and `canView` gating assembly rather than just rendering) is a
 * structural property a source scan can't verify — that's covered instead by
 * `app/features/public-roster/public-roster.server.test.ts`, which calls the
 * assembly function directly and inspects its real keys.

# CLAUDE.md — `@gdgjp/gdg-lib`

Repo-wide conventions in `../CLAUDE.md`. This file = lib-specific only.

Shared RP building blocks for the four downstream apps (`tinyurl`, `img`, `scheduler`, `wiki`), plus signed-cookie primitives. The IdP (`accounts/`) uses Better Auth's OAuth Provider plugin and only consumes shared types from this package; do not add IdP-side handlers here.

No build step for workspace consumption: source TS exported directly (`"main": "./src/index.ts"`),
bundled by each consumer. No `lint`/`dev` scripts here — those run at root via Turborepo + Biome.

```
pnpm --filter @gdgjp/gdg-lib typecheck
pnpm --filter @gdgjp/gdg-lib test
pnpm --filter @gdgjp/gdg-lib exec vitest run src/auth/cookie.test.ts   # single file
```

## `pnpm build` — the one exception (external publish only)

`pnpm --filter @gdgjp/gdg-lib build` compiles **only `src/acl/**`** (not the rest of the
package) to `gdg-lib/dist/`, via `scripts/build-publish-package.mjs`. This is not used by
anything inside this monorepo — every in-repo consumer (including `agents-index`) keeps
importing `@gdgjp/gdg-lib/acl/agent` as workspace TS source, unaffected by this build.

It exists solely so `gdg-lib/dist/` can be `npm publish`-ed to GitHub Packages as
**`@gdg-jp/gdg-lib`** (a different, org-scoped name — GitHub Packages requires the scope to
match the owning org) for `xangi`, an external repo that cannot resolve a `file:../gdgjp/gdg-lib`
sibling checkout. See `docs/agents-local-refactoring/13-xangi-packaging.md` and ADR-031.

Do not widen what `build` compiles or what its generated `dist/package.json` exports — it is
deliberately narrower than this package's real `exports` map (`./acl/agent` only,
nothing Workers/React-coupled). `pnpm --filter @gdgjp/gdg-lib test` covers the shape of the
generated manifest (`scripts/build-publish-package.test.ts`); keep it passing when you touch
either script.

## Architecture (from `src/index.ts`)

- `src/auth/cookie.ts` — `signPayload` / `verifyPayload` (HMAC-SHA256 + JSON + base64url) plus cookie I/O (`serializeCookie`, `parseCookies`, `readCookie`, `clearedCookie`). Pure WebCrypto, no Node deps. Used by both this RP factory and by `accounts/`.
- `src/auth/rp.ts` — `initializeRpAuth(config)` factory returning the instance every RP wires under `/api/auth/*` and `/auth/signout*`. Bulk of the package.
- `src/auth/index.ts` — shared types `AuthUser`, `UserClaims`, `UserChapter`, `ChapterRole`; `ClaimsUnavailableError`; `SSO_PROVIDER_ID = "gdgjp"`; generic `getSessionUser` / `requireUser` for any `{ api: { getSession } }`-shaped auth (legacy better-auth callsites).
- `src/auth/bearer.ts` — Bearer-token identity lookups for non-browser (CLI/agent) callers, both backed by Accounts. `getBearerIdentity` is the compatibility path (any valid OAuth client token, resolved via OIDC `/userinfo`, malformed chapter rows dropped individually) — used by connpass and wiki, which predate the CLI scope and must keep their current `/userinfo` semantics. `getCliIdentity` is the strict path (only a `gdg-cli` token carrying the `https://gdgs.jp/scopes/cli` scope, resolved via Accounts' `/api/cli/v1/identity`, whole response rejected on any malformed field) — used by new CLI mutation APIs (tinyurl/img/sns). Do not swap connpass/wiki onto the strict helper as a "compatible" refactor; it is a narrower authorization boundary, not a drop-in.

## RP factory — load-bearing invariants (`rp.ts`)

- **Runtime is Cloudflare Workers, not Node.** Vitest env is `"node"` but deploy target is Workers — use `crypto.subtle`, `D1Database`, `fetch`. Avoid Node-only APIs.
- **ID Tokens are mandatory.** Authorization uses PKCE S256, state, and nonce; callback validation passes `idTokenExpected: true` and `expectedNonce`. UserInfo is fetched with the validated ID Token `sub` as `expectedSubject`.
- **Local `user.id` is RP-minted.** Stable external identity is `(oidc_issuer, oidc_subject)`. Verified email is permitted only for a one-time link of legacy rows and conflicts fail closed.
- **Tokens are server-side.** The signed session cookie carries only a random session ID and display identity. Access, refresh, and ID tokens live in D1 `oidc_session`; refresh-token rotation is persisted with a compare-and-swap update.
- **Two cookies**: `{cookiePrefix}-session` (30d) and `{cookiePrefix}-oidc-tx` (10m, PKCE verifier + state + nonce + return_to). Prefix is per-app, isolating cookies on the same parent domain.
- **`secure` flips on `appUrl`**: `isLocalAppUrl` strips `Secure` for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` so `wrangler dev` works over HTTP. Prod stays HTTPS-only.
- **HTTP discovery only for localhost.** `getIssuerConfig` passes `oidc.allowInsecureRequests` only when IdP issuer URL is `http:`. Don't widen.
- **Module-level caches.** `issuerCache` (per issuer/client) and `inflightClaims` (per session ID; dedupes concurrent UserInfo work within one isolate). Discovery promise evicted on rejection so transient failures don't poison the isolate. OIDC HTTP calls have a 10-second bound and may use an RP-provided internal `fetch` transport.
- **`getFreshClaims` persists rotation in D1.** Concurrent isolates recover by re-reading the winning token row.
- **`safeReturnTo`** enforces same-origin redirect targets. Route new redirect entry points through it.
- **Logout follows RP-Initiated Logout.** Use discovery's `end_session_endpoint`, an `id_token_hint`, and an allowlisted same-origin post-logout redirect.

## Types are an API contract

Changing `AuthUser` / `UserClaims` / `UserChapter` / `ChapterRole` in `src/auth/index.ts` ripples into every RP via `workspace:*`. Run repo-root `pnpm typecheck` and update the IdP `/userinfo` response in `accounts/` in lockstep — `parseClaims` in `rp.ts` bridges the two.

Commit scope: `gdg-lib`.
